silent: completely silent. Zero logging output.
win: Just the �npm ok� or �npm not ok� message at the end.
error: When something unexpected and bad happens.
warn: When something odd or potentially dangerous is happening.
info: Helpful information so you can track what�s happening.
verbose: Even more. Perhaps just a wee bit obnoxious, even.
